# random-spanish-name
JS file that generates an object with a method that return a random spanish full name

I created a factory object with three arrays inside (names, firstName and secondName) and a method who retunrs the full name. I each array I put the most popular names, first names and second names of Spain.

I obtained all the data from INE (Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica). It was really fun diving on so many information.

I hope you enjoy it!
